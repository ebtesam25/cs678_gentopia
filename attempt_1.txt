*Response 0*:  Let's solve each problem step-by-step.

### Problem 1: 

Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   - Sold at green house: \( \frac{x}{3} \)
   - Remaining: \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \)

2. She sold 2 more at the red house:
   - Sold at red house: \( 2 \)
   - Remaining: \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \)

3. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left:
   - What was left before orange house: \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \)
   - Sold at orange house: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \)

   Thus, the remaining after the orange house sale becomes:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) 
   \]

   Simplifying this, we have:
   \[
   = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) 
   = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) 
   = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 
   = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

4. We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \Rightarrow x = 18
   \]

Thus, Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.

### Problem 2:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance driven during this time: 
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. He then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - After driving for 2 hours in standstill traffic, he doesn't move during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. He then has 1.5 hours left to drive (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours driven):
   - During this time, he drives at 80 mph, covering:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. Total distance John effectively drove towards home in these 4 hours:
   - Distance he drove in 4 hours (ignoring the standstill traffic) is:
   \[
   15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

5. He initially was 180 miles from home:
   - Thus, distance from home after 4 hours:
   \[
   180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
   \]

So, **John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours**.

----------
*Response 1*:  Let's solve the two problems step by step.

### Problem 1

Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **At the green house**: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Vacuum cleaners left: \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. **At the red house**: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.
   - Vacuum cleaners left: \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. **At the orange house**: She sold half of what was left after the red house.
   - The amount left before selling at the orange house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
   - Half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
   - Vacuum cleaners left after the orange house: 
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1.
   \]

4. **According to the problem**, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5.
   \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 18.
   \]

So, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is **18**.

### Problem 2

1. **John's initial drive**: He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. 
   - Distance traveled: 
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}.
   \]

2. **John turns around**: He wants to get home and has a total of 4 hours for that. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - He goes 2 hours without moving:
   - Distance he could have traveled in these 2 hours = \( 0 \) miles.

3. **Next half hour**: He drives at 30 mph.
   - Distance traveled in the half hour:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}.
   \]

4. **Remaining time**: He has 1 hour left (out of the 4-hour total).
   - He drives this last hour at 80 mph.
   - Distance traveled in the last hour:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 80 \text{ miles}.
   \]

5. **Total distance to home**: He has traveled a total of:
   \[
   15 \text{ miles} + 80 \text{ miles} = 95 \text{ miles}.
   \]

6. **Calculating distance from home**: Since he drove initially away from home 180 miles:
   - Distance from home after these travels:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} - 95 \text{ miles} = 85 \text{ miles}.
   \]

At the end of those 4 hours, John is **85 miles** away from home.

----------
*Response 2*:  Let's solve each problem step by step.

### Problem 1:
Melanie sold a total of \( x \) vacuum cleaners. The sales go as follows:

1. **At the green house**: She sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. **At the red house**: She sold 2 more than what was sold at the green house, which amounts to:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} + 2
   \]
3. **At the orange house**: After selling at the first two houses, we calculate how many vacuum cleaners are left:
   - **Total sold so far**:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} + (\frac{x}{3} + 2) = \frac{2x}{3} + 2
   \]
   - **Left after red house**:
   \[
   x - \left( \frac{2x}{3} + 2 \right) = x - \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = \frac{x}{3} - 2
   \]
   - **Sold at the orange house**: She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1
   \]
4. **Total left after all sales**: It is given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   - Sold:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \left( \frac{x}{6} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} + 2 + \frac{x}{6} - 1 = \frac{3x}{6} + 1 = \frac{x}{2} + 1
   \]

   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
   \[
   x - \left( \frac{x}{2} + 1 \right) = 5
   \]
   - Simplify:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{2} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{2} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{2} = 6 \implies x = 12
   \]

So, Melanie started with 12 vacuum cleaners.

### Problem 2:
John drives for a total of 4 hours but has delays. Let's break this down.

1. **First 3 hours**:
   - He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - He turns around, so after 3 hours, he is 180 miles from home.

2. **Next 4 hours back home**:
   - **First 2 hours of the return trip**: He is in standstill traffic:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Next half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - After this, he has 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance covered on the way back home**:
   - He has travelled back:
   \[
   0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Distance from home at the end of those 4 hours**:
   - He was 180 miles away, and he covers 135 miles back:
   \[
   180 - 135 = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home.

### Final Answer:

*Response 3*:  Let's solve each problem step-by-step.

### Problem 1:
Melanie's sales of vacuum cleaners can be calculated step-by-step as follows:

1. Let the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with be \( x \).
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   \[
   \text{Sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   This leaves her with:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]
3. She sold 2 more at the red house:
   \[
   \text{After selling at red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]
4. Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   \[
   \text{Left after red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]
   Half of this would be:
   \[
   \text{Sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
5. After selling at the orange house, the remaining vacuum cleaners are:
   \[
   \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right)
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
6. We know from the problem that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.

### Problem 2:
Let's calculate John's position relative to home after his trip:

1. **First Leg**:
   John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Turning Around**:
   He realizes he forgot something and turns around. At this point, he needs to get back to home, covering the 180 miles he just drove.

3. **On the Way Back**:
   He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he goes 0 miles during this time.

4. **Next Half-Hour**:
   For the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Remaining Time - Driving Fast**:
   The total time until he needs to be home is 4 hours. He has already spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving, totaling 2.5 hours. Thus, he has:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} - 2.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   He can drive for 1.5 hours at 80 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculating Distance from Home**:
   Now, we need to find out how far he is from home after driving back. The total distance he covered driving back home (including the distance he drove before turning around):
   \[
   \text{Total distance towards home} = 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}
   \]
   He initially was 180 miles away. Therefore, his distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, John is **45 miles** away from home at the end of the 4 hours.

### Final Answer:
Now we can summarize the solution in the required format:
```json
{"problem1":"18","problem2":"45"}
```
----------
*Response 4*:  Let's solve each problem step by step.

### Problem 1:
Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **At the green house**: She sold a third, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \). After that, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. **At the red house**: She sold 2 more, so now she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. **At the orange house**: She sold half of what was left. The amount left before the orange house sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
   - Half of this amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
   - After selling at the orange house, the remaining vacuum cleaners will be:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right)
     \]
     Simplifying that:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
     \]
4. We know that after all sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5.
   \]
   Adding 1 to both sides gives:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 3 yields:
   \[
   x = 18.
   \]

So, Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.

### Problem 2:
Let's calculate John's total distance and his situation during his trip.

1. **Going to the point of turnaround**: 
   - John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}.
     \]

2. **Turnaround**: After reaching 180 miles from home, he realized he forgot something and turned around.

3. **Trip back** (total 4 hours):
   - He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he has now 2 hours left to drive.

4. **Driving for 0.5 hours at 30 mph**: 
   - In this half hour, he covers:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}.
     \]
   - Total time passed so far: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours with \( 2 \text{ hours remaining} \).

5. **Driving for the remaining time at 80 mph**: 
   - He drives for \( 2 \text{ hours} \) next at 80 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 160 \text{ miles}.
     \]

6. **Total distance covered during return trip**:
   - **Total distance back towards home** (includes 15 miles at 30 mph and 160 miles at 80 mph):
   \[
   \text{Total distance back} = 15 + 160 = 175 \text{ miles}.
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining distance from home**:
   - John was originally 180 miles from home:
   - After driving back 175 miles, he is now:
   \[
   180 - 175 = 5 \text{ miles from home}.
   \]

So, after all calculations, John is **5 miles from home** at the end of those 4 hours.

### Final Answer:
```json
{"problem1":"18","problem2":"5"}
```
----------
*Response 5*:  Let's solve each problem step by step.

# Problem 1: Melanie's Vacuum Cleaner Sales

Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie started with.

1. At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners:
   \[
   \text{Sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   After this sale, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. At the red house, she sold 2 more:
   \[
   \text{Sold at red house} = 2
   \]
   Now, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left:
   \[
   \text{Sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale becomes:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right)
   \]

   To simplify:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

   Now substituting this back:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

   Now we know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   Adding 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   Multiplying by 3:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

# Problem 2: John's Drive and Return Home

1. **Travel to the turn-around point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance to the turn-around point} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Return trip conditions:**
   - He tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - The first 2 hours are spent in standstill traffic:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in 2 hours (traffic)} = 0 \, \text{miles}
   \]

   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in half an hour} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hour} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

   - After that, he has:
   \[
   4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \text{ left to drive.}
   \]
   In these 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in 1.5 hours} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance returned toward home:**
   - Total distance John covered going home:
   \[
   \text{Total return distance} = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Distance from home at the end:**
   - Since he was originally 180 miles away and covered 135 miles, his distance from home is:
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = 180 - 135 = 45 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Combining the results, we have:

```json
{"problem1":"18","problem2":"45"}
```
----------
*Response 6*:  Let's solve each problem step by step.

### Problem 1: Melanie's Vacuum Cleaners
1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of them at the green house: 
   \[
   \text{Sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
3. She sold 2 more to the red house:
   \[
   \text{Sold at red house} = 2
   \]
4. After selling at the green and red houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) = x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left:
   \[
   \text{Sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
6. The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = \frac{2x}{3} + 1
   \]
7. The number of vacuum cleaners left is given as 5, so we can express it as:
   \[
   x - \left(\frac{2x}{3} + 1\right) = 5
   \]
8. Simplifying this:
   \[
   x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Thus, Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.

### Problem 2: John's Journey
1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance to turn around} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]
2. He plans to return home and has 4 hours for the return trip, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, traveling 0 miles.
3. After 2 hours of standstill, he has 2 hours left to reach home.
4. In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered at 30 mph} = 0.5 \times 30 = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]
5. Now he has 1.5 hours left (2 hours total - 0.5 hours), and he begins driving at 80 mph:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered at 80 mph in 1.5 hours} = 1.5 \times 80 = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]
6. The total distance he has covered on the return trip is:
   \[
   15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}
   \]
7. He initially traveled 180 miles away from home, so the distance he is from home after 4 hours is:
   \[
   180 - 135 = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, John is **45 miles from home** at the end of those 4 hours.

Finally, we can present the solutions in JSON format as follows:

*Response 7*:  To solve both problems, let's break them down step by step.

### Problem 1: Melanie's Vacuum Cleaners

Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Sold at the Green House**: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   
   After this sale, she has:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. **Sold at the Red House**: She sold 2 more at the red house. After this sale, she has:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. **Sold at the Orange House**: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. The amount she sold there is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   After this sale, she has:
   \[
   \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

4. We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \\
   x = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

Thus, Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.

### Problem 2: John's Journey

1. **Distance traveled during the first leg**: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Turning around**: He realizes he forgot something and turns around, so he has to return 180 miles.

3. **Time spent on the return journey**: He attempts to get back in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so:
   - Time left after traffic: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ hours} \)

4. **Driving in traffic**: He doesn’t cover any distance in the traffic.

5. **Driving at 30 mph**: For the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]
   After this, he has 180 miles - 15 miles = 165 miles remaining.

6. **Driving at 80 mph**: He has 1.5 hours left to drive (2 hours total - 0.5 hours already spent). At 80 mph, the distance he covers in 1.5 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]
   After this, the remaining distance to home is:
   \[
   165 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, at the end of the 4 hours, John is **45 miles away from home**.

Combining both solutions, we have:

```json
{"problem1":"18","problem2":"45"}
```
----------
*Response 8*:  Let's tackle each problem step by step.

### Problem 1:
Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman who sold her vacuum cleaners in the following manner:

1. Sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. Sold 2 more at the red house.
3. Sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with. 

**Step 1: Sales at the green house**
- She sold a third at the green house: 
  \[
  \text{Sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
  \]
- Remaining vacuum cleaners:
  \[
  \text{Remaining after green house} = x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
  \]

**Step 2: Sales at the red house**
- She sold 2 more at the red house:
  \[
  \text{Remaining after red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
  \]

**Step 3: Sales at the orange house**
- She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
  \[
  \text{Sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
  \]
- Remaining vacuum cleaners after the orange house:
  \[
  \text{Remaining after orange house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
  \]
  Simplifying this:
  \[
  \text{Remaining} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
  \]
- We also know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
  \[
  \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
  \[
  \frac{x}{3} = 6
  \]
  \[
  x = 18
  \]

So, Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.

### Problem 2:
John's journey can be broken down into three segments after he turns around:

1. **First 2 hours in standstill traffic**: 
   Speed = 0 mph, Distance = 0 miles.

2. **Next half hour driving at 30 mph**:
   Time = 0.5 hours, Speed = 30 mph,
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \times 0.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Final 1.5 hours driving at 80 mph**:
   Time = 1.5 hours, Speed = 80 mph,
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \times 1.5 = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

**Total Distance Driven After Turning Around**:
- From standstill traffic: 0 miles
- From the next half hour: 15 miles
- From the last 1.5 hours: 120 miles
- Total Distance = \( 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles} \)

**Total Distance He Had Originally Driven Before Turning Around**:
- He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[
\text{Distance} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step: Calculate Distance from Home**
- Distance from home (after driving back 135 miles from the 180 miles):
\[
\text{Distance from home} = 180 - 135 = 45 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answers
- For Problem 1: **18 vacuum cleaners**
- For Problem 2: **45 miles**

Finally, we return the solutions in the requested format:

```json
{"problem1":18,"problem2":45}
```
----------
*Response 9*:  Let's solve each problem step by step.

### Problem 1

**Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.**

1. **Sales at the Green House:** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners:
   - Sold: \( \frac{x}{3} \)
   - Remaining: \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \)

2. **Sales at the Red House:** She sold 2 more:
   - Sold: \( 2 \)
   - Remaining: \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \)

3. **Sales at the Orange House:** She sold half of what was left:
   - What was left before this sale: \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \)
   - Half of that: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \)
   - Remaining after this sale:
     \[
     \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
     \]
   - Set the remaining vacuum cleaners equal to 5:
     \[
     \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
     \]

So, the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is **18**.

### Problem 2

**Calculate the distance John drives and the distance remaining home.**

1. **Driving Outward:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance outward} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Driving Home:**
   - He turns around and has 4 hours to get home.
   - The first 2 hours are in standstill traffic (0 mph):
     \[
     \text{Distance covered} = 0 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Then for the next half hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph:
     \[
     \text{Distance covered} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Remaining time to drive at a speed of 80 mph:
     - Time left after 2.5 hours: \( 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \)
     - Distance covered at 80 mph:
       \[
       \text{Distance covered} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
       \]

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Way Back:**
   - Total distance back to home:
     \[
     0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Distance From Home:**
   - He originally was 180 miles away, and after driving back, the remaining distance to home:
     \[
     \text{Remaining distance} = 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, John is **45 miles** away from home at the end of those 4 hours.
