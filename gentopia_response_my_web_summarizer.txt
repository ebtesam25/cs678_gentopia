┃ Tom Zimmermann's paper, co-authored with Ruotong Wang and others, investigates trust in AI-powered code generation tools through a two-stage qualitative ┃
┃ study. Here’s a summary of the methodology:                                                                                                              ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                          ┃
┃  1 Interviews: The first stage involved interviewing 17 software developers to understand their perceptions of trust in AI tools. The interviews aimed   ┃
┃    to contextualize developers' notions of trust and identify challenges they face in building appropriate trust in these tools. Three main challenges   ┃
┃    were identified:                                                                                                                                      ┃
┃     • Building Appropriate Expectations: Developers struggle to set realistic expectations for AI performance.                                           ┃
┃     • Configuring AI Tools: There is a need for better customization options to align AI behavior with user preferences.                                 ┃
┃     • Validating AI Suggestions: Developers find it challenging to assess the validity of suggestions made by AI.                                        ┃
┃  2 Design Probe Study: In the second stage, a design probe study was conducted to explore potential design concepts that could support the               ┃
┃    trust-building process. This involved:                                                                                                                ┃
┃     • Communicating AI Performance: Developing ways to effectively communicate the capabilities and limitations of AI tools to help users set proper     ┃
┃       expectations.                                                                                                                                      ┃
┃     • User Configuration: Allowing users to configure AI tools by setting and adjusting their preferences.                                               ┃
┃     • Indicators of Model Mechanism: Providing indicators that help users evaluate AI suggestions based on the underlying model mechanisms.              ┃
┃  3 Feedback Gathering: The study collected feedback from developers on how these design concepts could assist in building appropriate trust in AI tools, ┃
┃    as well as identifying potential risks associated with these designs.                                                                                 ┃
